## Context

This work will be made in the context of the **Digi-dojo project** being developed at the Free University of Bolzano (Unibz). The Digi-dojo project is a platform to support development teams in Software Startups that work remotely. The goal is to provide for those teams the interactive and creative environment of a startup. In this work, the focus will be in the integration of existing Software Engineer tools with the platform, which has a microservices-based architecture. As part of the scope of this work, one of the challenges will be to identify extension points on the platform in order to allow other tools to be integrated in the future.
